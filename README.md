# Titanic Survivor Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival probability of Titanic passengers using machine learning techniques. The project uses five different machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, and XGBoost, in the Python programming language.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required packages. You can do this using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vkadu68/titanic-survivor-prediction.git
cd titanic-survivor-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
The data used in this project is available on Kaggle. The data contains information about the passengers, including their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

## Models
The project uses five different machine learning models to predict the survival probability of Titanic passengers. The models are:

Random Forest
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
KNN
XGBoost
Results
After applying data cleaning and feature engineering techniques, the model accuracy improved from 0.54066 to 0.80382. The project achieved a position in the top 4% of the total submissions in the Kaggle competition.
